# Overview
This Chrome extension specifically monitors the wallet balance for Interakt.ai users by intercepting the wallet balance API call on https://app.interakt.ai. The extension displays the current wallet balance both in the extension popup and on the webpage, providing users with real-time visibility of their Interakt.ai wallet status.

# Core Features

1. API Interception System
   - Specifically intercepts the Interakt.ai wallet balance API endpoint
   - URL: https://api.interakt.ai/v1/organizations/{org_id}/payments/wallet/
   - Why it's important: Enables real-time balance tracking for Interakt.ai users
   - How it works: Uses Chrome's webRequest API to monitor the specific API call

2. Balance Display Component
   - Shows wallet balance in the extension popup
   - Displays balance directly on the Interakt.ai webpage
   - Updates in real-time when new balance data is received
   - Why it's important: Provides immediate visibility of wallet status
   - How it works: React components that subscribe to balance updates

# User Experience

User Personas:
1. Interakt.ai User
   - Needs to monitor their Interakt.ai wallet balance
   - Requires real-time updates
   - Wants quick access to balance information

Key User Flows:
1. Installation and Usage
   - Install extension
   - Navigate to https://app.interakt.ai
   - View balance in extension popup and on webpage

UI/UX Considerations:
- Clean, minimal design
- Easy-to-read balance display
- Consistent with Interakt.ai's design language
- Responsive popup design

# Technical Architecture

System Components:
1. Background Script
   - API interception logic for specific Interakt.ai endpoint
   - Data processing
   - State management

2. Content Script
   - Webpage integration for https://app.interakt.ai
   - DOM manipulation
   - Balance display injection

3. Popup Interface
   - React-based UI
   - Balance display

Data Models:
1. Balance Data
   - Balance amount
   - Last updated timestamp

APIs and Integrations:
- Chrome Extension APIs
  - webRequest (for API interception)
  - tabs (for webpage integration)
- React for UI components
- State management (Context API for simplicity)

# Development Roadmap

# Risks and Mitigations

Technical Challenges:
1. API Interception
   - Risk: API response structure changes
   - Mitigation: Implement error handling and graceful fallback

2. Performance
   - Risk: Extension might slow down the webpage
   - Mitigation: Optimize interception logic and minimize DOM operations

3. Security
   - Risk: Handling sensitive wallet data
   - Mitigation: Implement secure data handling practices

# Appendix

Technical Specifications:
1. Development Stack
   - React for UI
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Chrome Extension APIs
   - Context API for state management

2. Performance Requirements
   - Response time < 100ms for balance updates
   - Memory usage < 20MB
   - CPU usage < 2% during normal operation

3. Browser Compatibility
   - Chrome (primary)

4. URL Restrictions
